<h2 id="META_TOLUENE_SULPHONIC_ACID_and_RELATED_COMPOUNDS">META TOLUENE SULPHONIC ACID and RELATED COMPOUNDS</h2>

<p>Theoretically toluene should yield three isomeric mono
sulphonic acids, in which the entering sulphonic acid group occupies
the positions ortho, meta, or para to the methyl group.</p>

<p>The action of sulphuric acid on toluene was first investigated
by Jaworsky, (Ztschr. Chem. 1,272), who described one
toluene sulphonic acid as the resulting compound. In 1869 Engelhardt
and Latschinoff (Ibid. 617), heated toluene with sulphuric
acid and made and studied the potassium salt of the resulting acid.
They obtained two forms, and identified them by fusion with caustic
potash which converted them into the ortho and para cresols,
showing that sulphonation had taken place in the positions ortho
and para to the methyl group.</p>

<p>Barth (Ann. chem. (Liebig) 152,91), working similarly
but fusing under different conditions which also caused oxidation
of the methyl group to a carboxyl group obtained para hydroxy
benzoic acid and salicylic acid (ortho hydroxy benzoic acid.) This
also proved that the sulphonic acid group had entered in the ortho
and para positions.</p>

<p>Anna Wolkow (Ztschr. Chem (1870) 321), confirmed this
work but ascribed the meta position to the sulphonic acid that
passed into salicylic acid. She also made two acid chlorides
and amides and recorded their melting points.</p>

<p>Fittig and Ramsay (Ann. chem. (Liebig) 168,242) studied
this result of Anna Wolkow, and to determine and settle the constitutions
of the sulphonic acids, carefully prepared and purified
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
their sulphonic acids; they proved definitely that no meta acid
was formed, and that the products were only the ortho and para
toluene sulphonic acids.</p>

<p>Hubner and Post (Ann. chem. (Liebig) 169,47) worked
on pure para brom toluene, and obtained two para brom toluene
mono-sulphonic acids, one of which they proved to be the ortho
acid by removal of the bromine by metallic sodium, and oxidation
to salicylic acid. By exclusion they decided that the
other acid must be one containing the sulphonic acid group in
meta position to the methyl group.</p>

<p>F.C.G. Müller (same as Hubner and Post) made the
barium salt of ortho brom toluene sulphonic acid, and then removed
the bromine by treatment with sodium amalgam. The excess
of alkali was removed by sulphuric acid, the sodium sulphate
removed by evaporation and crystallization, and the residue dried.
On treatment with phosphorus pentachloride an oily toluene sulphonchloride
was obtained; this was decomposed by heating with
water, the hydrochloric acid removed by repeated evaporations, and
the syrup thus obtained evaporated to a crystalline condition.
Several salts were made and studied. His amide melted at 90-91.
Because this acid differed in properties from the two previously
mentioned, Müller considered it to be the meta toluene sulphonic
acid.</p>

<p>About this time F. Gervor (Ann. chem. (Liebig) 169,383),
made ortho diazo toluene sulphonic acid by subjecting ortho
toluidine sulphonic acid to nitrous fumes. This was decomposed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
with alcohol under pressure, and a sodium salt of the acid obtained;
this was converted into the chloride and an amide which
melted at 148, differing in this and other properties from the
amides of the ortho and para toluene sulphonic acids previously
known.</p>

<p>In 1874 Pechmann (Ibid., 173,195) obtained a quantity
of para toluidine meta sulphonic acid by heating para toluidine
with sulphuric acid, and crystallizing out the para toluidine
ortho sulphonic acid and disulphonic acids, leaving the meta
acid in solution because of its greater solubility. The diazo
compound was made by treatment of the acid in alcoholic suspension
with nitrous fumes, and decomposed with alcohol under
pressure. Various salts of the resulting sulphonic acid were
made and studied, also the chloride and amide which melted
"somewhere below 100".</p>

<p>In 1875 Pagel (Ann. chem. (Liebig) 176,297) working
on ortho toluidine sulphonic acid, made a toluene sulphonic
acid which resembled Muller’s. His amide melted at 104.</p>

<p>In 1877 Beckurts (Ber.d.che. Ges. 10, 943), seeking
for a good method of obtaining pure ortho toluene sulphonic
acid, heated toluene and sulphuric acid in the ordinary way,
and made the potassium salts of the resulting acids. By treatment
with phosphorus pentachloride he obtained the acid chlorides
which he separated by cooling to -15, and filtering off
the solid para compound. The remaining liquid was transformed
into an amide and purified by fractional crystallization. Two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
compounds were obtained with sharp melting points of 153 and
104. From this work he concluded that the sulphonation of
toluene yielded all the three possible acids.</p>

<p>Fahlberg (Am. Chem. J. 1, 170), doubted Beckurts’
statement, because although his acid showed different properties
he neglected to prove its constitution by converting
it into the hydroxy benzoic acid. He therefore repeated
Beckurts’ work, and identified the amide melting at 154 as
coming from ortho toluene sulphonic acid, by conversion into
salicylic acid. The other amide with a sharp, constant melting
point of 108 was oxidized, and the products separated and identified
as para sulphamine benzoic acid, anhydro ortho sulphamine
benzoic acid, and acid potassium ortho sulphobenzoate. These
were the products one would expect from an oxidation of a mixture
of the ortho and para toluene sulphonamides. Further
proof that his acid was a mixture was obtained by mixing amounts
of pure ortho and para toluene sulphonic acids, and by repeated
crystallizations a form was obtained which melted at 108.</p>

<p>F.H.S. Muller (Ber. d. chem. Ges. 13, 1348), mentioned
the formation of meta toluene sulphonic acid by the action of
sulphurous acid upon the corresponding diazo compound, but gave
no details except the melting points of his amide, anilide, and
toluide.</p>

<p>Claesson and Wallin in 1879 (Ibid. p. 1848), claimed
that they had obtained meta toluene sulphonic acid by the action
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
of chlorsulphonic acid upon toluene.  They used very large
quantities of materials.  They obtained three acids, and
identified them as the ortho and para, and called the third
the meta acid, despite the fact that they had knowledge of
Fahlberg’s work.</p>

<p>The next step was undertaken by R. Otto (Ibid, 13,
1292), at the request of Beckurts. He examined some of the
latter’s supposed meta toluene sulphonamide, and found it
to be a mixture of the amides of the ortho and para acids.</p>

<p>Nevile and Winther (Ibid. 13, 1940), while investigating
the formation of amino sulphonic acids, obtained a
toluene sulphonic acid by heating ortho diazo toluene sulphonic
acid with alcohol under pressure, and also by reducing brom
toluene sulphonic acid with sodium amalgam.  It was converted
into the chloride and amide,&mdash;the latter melting at 106.5-107.5.</p>

<p>In 1886, Valin (Ibid. 2952), convinced by the work of
Otto that Fahlberg’s views were correct, and that he and Klason
had not obtained meta toluene sulphonic acid, again attacked
the problem; an acid was made and salts described.</p>

<p>In 1891, Metcalf (Am. Che. J. 15,301) (Dissertation,
1892), proved that decomposition of para diazo toluene meta
sulphonic acid with ethyl alcohol under pressure resulted in
the formation of para ethoxy meta toluene sulphonic acid in
far greater quantity.  Consequently the toluene meta sulphonic
acid could not have been obtained by either Pechmann or Valin.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>Griffin, (Dissertation, 1895), prepared what he
thought was a solution of the meta toluene sulphonic acid from
the amide, and made and studied several salts as well as the
anilide and toluide. However he did not investigate his solution
to find out what it contained, but went ahead on the assumption
that he had a solution of this acid.  It is on the
basis of his lack of investigation that I am working.</p>

<p>The derivatives of para toluene sulphonic acid have
been made and studied by Newell, (Dissertation, 1895), and are
being investigated further. He prepared para tolyl phenyl
sulphone by the Friedal-Crafts reaction, para phenyl sulphone
benzoic acid by oxidation of the sulphone with chromic acid,
its salts, chloride, amide, and anilide, and para benzoyl
diphenyl sulphone from the acid by the Friedal-Crafts reaction,
and studied their reactions and properties.</p>

<p>The analogous derivatives of ortho toluene sulphonic
acid were made and studied by Canter, (Dissertation, 1900).
He prepared ortho tolyl phenyl sulphone by the Friedal-Crafts
reaction, ortho phenyl sulphone benzoic acid by oxidation of
the sulphone by potassium permanganate, its chloride, amide,
and anilide, and ortho benzoyl diphenyl sulphone from the acid
by the Friedal-Crafts reaction.</p>

<p>The analogous derivatives of the meta toluene sulphonic
acid with one or two exceptions have not been made or studied,
nor has the acid itself been prepared in a form which could be
recognized.  The following derivatives of meta toluene sulphonic
acid have been made and studied; the amide by Müller, Pechmann,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
Pagel, Beckurts, F.H.S. Muller, Nevile and Winther, Chase
Palmer, Klason, Valin, Noyes and Walker, Metcalf, and Griffin;
meta sulphamine benzoic acid by Limpricht and Uslar, and Griffin;
meta toluene sulphon anilide and toluide by Muller and
Wiesinger, (Ber. d. chem. Ges, 12,1348), and by Griffin; the
latter also made and studied several metallic salts.</p>

<p>The literature on the ortho and para toluene sulphonic
acids and their derivatives is voluminous, and covers
a great many derivatives which have been thoroughly studied
and whose structure has been determined. The literature on
meta toluene sulphonic acid is very meagre, comparatively, and
all that could be found is mentioned in this paper. This
would seem to indicate that investigators have avoided this
series, and apparently the reason is due to the difficulties
encountered in isolating the free acid.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<h2 id="THEORETICAL_DISCUSSION">THEORETICAL DISCUSSION</h2>

<p>The object of this paper is to prepare a solution of
meta toluene sulphonic acid, as probably obtained by Griffin,
by the most promising of the investigated methods and to find
an acceptable one for isolating the acid in the solid state.
After a solution is obtained similar to that found by Griffin,
(loc. cit.), the intention is to remove as much water as possible
by distillation under diminished pressure and then to
precipitate the acid by the method of Kastle, (Amer. Chem. J.,
Vol. 44, page 483), namely saturate the remaining solution with
gaseous hydrochloric acid. It is hoped that in this way the
solid acid may be obtained which can then be studied.</p>

<p>As has been proved by previous experimenters and discussed
above, no direct method of sulphonating toluene will
give any of the meta sulphonic acid. Therefore to get a compound
containing a methyl group with a sulphonic acid group in
the position meta to it some compound with these already in
that position and containing some other group which can be replaced
by hydrogen might be used, i.e. a disubstituted toluene.
The two groups which can be readily replaced by hydrogen are
the amino group and bromine, the former by the diazo reaction
and the latter by treatment with metallic sodium; the easier
of the two to prepare and replace is the amino group and this
is the one made use of in this synthesis. This replacement has
been widely studied (Amer. Chem. J., by Palmer 8, 243; Orndorff
9, 387; Graham 11, 319; Dashiell 15, 124; Metcalf 15, 301; Parks
15, 320; Shober 15, 379; Beeson 16, 244; and Dissertations by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Weida, Cameron, and Chamberlain, all 1894.), and the various
conditions affecting it determined. The foregoing investigators
decomposed their diazo compounds with alcohols sometimes
using certain substances to cause the alkoxy or hydrogen reactions
to take place. Later investigators (Buchka, Berichte
23, 1628, St. Von Niemantowski, Ibid., 34, 3325 (1901), Ullman
and Bieleck, Ibid., 34, 2174, and Bigelow, J. Amer. Chem. Soc.,
Vol. 41, 1566), have shown that this decomposition is greatly
increased by the presence of copper powder. As the first method
has been more extensively studied it was adopted in this case.</p>

<p>The action of methyl, ethyl, and n-propyl alcohols
on diazo compounds has been well studied by the above authors,
and it has been shown that the first two at ordinary pressures
give the alkoxy reaction either in whole or in part; n-propyl
alcohol gives the hydrogen reaction only. Also the first two
give the hydrogen reaction in the presence of zinc dust or sodium
carbonate, but in these cases form salts of the acid. On account
of its rarity n-propyl alcohol was not used, but n-butyl
alcohol which is available in large quantities and in a pure
condition was employed. Recent advances in fermentation as applied
to organic chemistry have made this substance easily obtainable
as a byproduct in the production of acetone which was needed
in large amounts during the late war. Its use was found to be
successful; it boils at 117 and so can be easily distilled off
after decomposition has been effected without a great increase
in temperature above the boiling point of water, which increase
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
Griffin (loc. cit.) showed to cause carbonization.  For this
reason i-amyl alcohol although available was not considered,&mdash;also
higher alcohols because of this fact and because of their
rarity.</p>

<p>Of the four amino toluene sulphonic acids theoretically
possible in which the sulphonic acid group is in the meta position
in reference to the methyl group only two are commonly
known, No. 1, and No. 2.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/010.png" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Methods of preparing No. 1 and No. 2 were found but without
details, so a method had to be worked out to obtain them easily
and in good yield. After a little experimenting No. 1, or
ortho toluidine sulphonic acid was readily obtained in good
yield and in a fairly pure condition. No. 2, or para toluidine
meta sulphonic acid was obtained in only a ten per cent yield and
by means of a much more difficult method of procedure. The preparation
of this acid was undertaken first and consumed a long
time; Griffin did his work starting with this acid and I hoped
to get as far as he did earlier. It was then available in the
market as was the ortho toluidine sulphonic acid, but now neither
are available.</p>

<p>The methods employed by earlier investigators when
they wished to isolate their diazo compounds was to suspend the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
substance to be diazotized in alcohol, and then pass in
nitrous fumes generated by dropping concentrated nitric
acid onto arsenious oxide. The diazo compound from ortho
toluidine sulphonic acid is so nearly insoluble in water that
it was found possible to diazotize it in water suspension,
and generate the nitrous fumes in the solution itself by
adding a solution of sodium nitrite to the water suspension
containing hydrochloric acid. After a short time the diazo
compound separates out and can be filtered off, washed and
dried. It is a very stable substance as compared with other
diazo compounds. This method was worked out, there being
no mention of it in the literature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<h2 id="SULPHONATION_OF_ORTHO_TOLUIDINE">SULPHONATION OF ORTHO TOLUIDINE</h2>

<p>Of the possible sulphonic acids of ortho toluidine
the commercial product of former days was the one in which the
sulphonic acid group was in the para position to the amino
group, and meta to the methyl group; thus this acid could find
use in preparing the toluene meta sulphonic acid if a method of
replacing the amino group by hydrogen could be found. This acid
is not now on the market in America because of its limited use
in dyestuffs. It is mentioned in Schultz and Julius, (“Farbestoff
Tabellen”, 1894 Edition, Trans. by F. C. Green), Cain, (“The
Manufacture of Intermediate Products for Dyes”) and Nevile and
Winther, (Ber. d. chem. Ges. 13, 1940.), which latter give a
method of preparation which was used industrially,&mdash;the baking of
ortho toluidine sulphate. Their description is rather indefinite
but after a few preliminary trials a suitable method was found.
I will describe all the experiments attempted, and include the
one finally adopted. The ortho toluidine used was (“Practical.”) obtained from
Eastman Kodak Co.</p>

<h3>Experiment 1.</h3>

<p>Ortho toluidine was suspended in water and conc. sulphuric
acid added with vigorous stirring until all the amine had
dissolved. The solution was heated to boiling until the sulphate
had dissolved, and then cooled and the crystals thus obtained filtered
off and dried. This was then powdered and ground with some
powdered oxalic acid. These mixtures with and without oxalic
acid were then baked until a sample was completely soluble in
sodium hydroxide. The mass had become a deep grayish purple. It dissolved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
in water to give a deep red solution. Nothing satisfactory
was obtained from any of these bakes, the formation
of a red dyestuff as mentioned by Nevile and Winther seeming
to be formed in a great quantity and very easily. Hence this
method was discarded.</p>

<h3>Experiment 2.</h3>

<p>In this case an excess of sulphuric acid was used.
After the oxalic acid had all been decomposed or driven off
the mass turned black and became very pitchy. Nothing could
be done with it so it was thrown away.</p>

<h3>Experiment 3.</h3>

<p>In this case an excess of ortho toluidine was used.
The red dyestuff was formed in great amount and very easily.
The temperature was kept below 195 to lose none of the
toluidine which boiled at 199.</p>

<h3>Experiment 4.</h3>

<p>This method gave the best results and is the one employed
in the preparation of all the material used in the thesis.
Equal weights of ortho toluidine and sulphuric acid (100gms. of
each were used; 100gms. of ortho toluidine is 108cc., and 100gms.
of sulphuric acid (s. g. 1.84) are 56cc.), were mixed and baked
at 190-195 until a sample would dissolve in ten per cent sodium
hydroxide solution to give a clear solution; this took one and
a half hours. The mixture at first melts in the solution of
the sulphate and sulphuric acid formed by the heat of combination;
as heating is continued it gradually becomes solid and finally
very hard; it has become gray in color. When it is perfectly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
dry a test is made to see if it dissolves in sodium hydroxide
giving a clear solution. If so, sulphonation is complete. By
using an oven with a glass door the reaction mixture can be
watched and the completion of the baking observed. However
the test for complete solubility should always be made. The
addition of powdered oxalic acid to the reaction mixture did
not seem to be of advantage, because no visible reaction commenced
until this had been driven off or decomposed. It is
usually added in producing sulphonic acids by baking the sulphates
of the amines to increase the porosity of the mass and
thus facilitate removal of the product. However here the
only effect seemed to be to retard the reaction, as the product
was the sane hard grayish mass as without the acid, and it was
just as difficult to dig it out. It took an hour longer to
complete the reaction with the addition of the oxalic acid.</p>

<p>The best results were obtained when the temperature
of the oven was kept at 193, although five degrees variation
did not appreciably affect the product. A lower temperature
gives little or no action, while a higher one drives off the
ortho toluidine and also seems to favor the formation of the
red dyestuff.</p>

<p>As stated above, complete sulphonation is shown by
the solubility of the acid in ten per cent sodium hydroxide
solution. If any unchanged amine is present as sulphate the
solution will become milky due to liberation of the insoluble
amine. On boiling a solution of the acid a slight hydrolysis
takes place so that the smell of ortho toluidine is present,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
yet the solution is always perfectly clear.</p>

<p>The product or “bake” appears as a hard grayish mass,
slightly porous. It is dug out, pulverized, boiled up in a
large evaporating dish, containing water and a little (10cc.)
hydrochloric acid, with animal charcoal and filtered. The
solution should be almost colorless. The effect of the slight
amount of hydrochloric acid was accidental; the first solutions
were always a deep red color due to some of the red dyestuff
seeming to be present, and the longer the solution was boiled
the redder it got. A little acid seems to prevent this entirely.
The solution is evaporated on a water bath until a scum
has formed on the surface when it is allowed to cool and crystallize.
It crystallizes in small almost white needles, which appear
to fill the entire liquid; this is deceptive as on filtering
the bulk is considerably reduced. They fall to a powder when
they are dry. If they are colored red or pink they are washed
while still on the filter with water; alcohol does not remove
this color.</p>

<p>The acid as formed has no melting point, but chars and
decomposes on heating. A sample was tested for nitrogen and sulphur
with very good positive results. On fusion with caustic
soda and acidification of the product a positive reaction was obtained
on the addition of bromine water as is customary with
phenols.</p>

<p>It was identified as identical with the acid of Nevile
and Winther (loc. cit.) by conversion thru the diazo compound
into dinitro ortho cresol, melting at 85.8 as described under
the description of the diazo compound.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<h2 id="SULPHONATION_OF_PARA_TOLUIDINE">SULPHONATION OF PARA TOLUIDINE</h2>

<p>Metcalf, (loc. cit.), gives a method for the preparation
of the sulphonic acids of para toluidine, and states
that both the possible acids are formed, with the meta position
(referred to the methyl group) in good yield. Schultz
and Julius, (“Farbestoff Tabellen”, 1894 Edition, Trans, by
F. C. Green), and Nevile and Winther, (loc. cit.), say that
the sulphonation of para toluidine gives a mixture of the sulphonic
acids, with the ortho (referred to the methyl group)
sulphonic acid in a much greater yield. As the sulphonation
of para nitro toluene gives (Dissertation, R. S. Norris, BPL.
5976.109) a ninety-five per cent yield of the ortho sulphonic
acid, it would seem as though the amino compound should give a
large yield of the acid (sulphonic acid group ortho to the
methyl group,) and such was found to be the case.</p>

<p>I followed Metcalf’s directions as follows: in an
apparatus fitted with an automatic stirrer and a thermometer
I placed 200 grams (110cc.) of twenty per cent fuming sulphuric
acid. I then slowly added with rapid stirring 100grams of
powdered para toluidine which was obtained from the Newport
Chemical Works. The addition took thirteen minutes. The
initial temperature of the solution was 18°C. The maximum
was obtained when about half the toluidine had been added and
was 148°C. The final temperature was 130°C. After addition
was complete I stirred for five minutes, and then slowly heated
the mixture to 180°C. and kept it there for an hour. Sulphonation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
was then complete. I then poured it into an equal
volume of cold water (220cc.) in an evaporating dish and allowed
it to stand over night. The next day the dish seemed
filled with grayish crystals; these were filtered off. The
solution was allowed to stand for four weeks with no results.
(Metcalf says that the disulphonic acid separated in three
weeks from his solution.)</p>

<p>I dissolved the crude acid obtained as above in ten
liters of water (Metcalf’s directions) and precipitated the
excess of sulphuric acid with barium hydroxide, and then filtered
the solution. It was a clear brownish color. I then
evaporated to 100cc. A smell of para toluidine was always
present in the vapor indicating a probable hydrolysis of the
acid. (Nevile and Winther (loc. cit.) say that this sulphonic
acid can be hydrolyzed by heating with water), A test
after sulphonation and before evaporation showed a sample to
be completely soluble in water, and no cloudiness was produced
when a sample was dissolved in sodium hydroxide, as is the
case if a solution of para toluidine sulphate is dissolved in
the same reagent. When the volume had reached 100cc. a light
brown crust had formed on top of the liquid and on cooling and
filtering two products were obtained; a light brown powdery
substance in larger amount (47.5 grams.), and a small amount
of hard square brown crystals. On evaporating the filtrate
nearly to dryness more material separated which did not look
like either of the above substances; it weighed twenty grams.
This has not been investigated as yet.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>As the brownish powdery substance was mixed with
the flat crystals produced above, a method had to be found to
separate them and purify each. I screened them as much as
possible with good results. I removed the last of the fine
powder by dissolving it off with hot water. Metcalf said
that they could be separated by their difference in specific
gravity in fifty per cent alcohol but this method was unsuccessful.
I boiled up the aqueous solution of the powdery
substance with animal charcoal, filtered and evaporated to
crystallization. Square, flat, white crystals were obtained
identical in all but color with those mentioned above. They
are soluble with difficulty in cold water, readily in hot,
and insoluble in alcohol. In these properties and in appearance
they compare to the ortho sulphonic acid of para toluidine
as made and described by Parks, (Dissertation, 1892). Metcalf
and Nevile and Winther say that the meta sulphonic acid of para
toluidine forms needles, but I obtained nothing that could in
any way be called needles. This sulphonic acid had no melting
point, but charred and decomposed. A test for elements showed
nitrogen and sulphur to be present. The aqueous solution had
a strong acid reaction to litmus.</p>

<p>In order to see if this might be the desired acid I
tried to prepare an acid chloride with phosphorus pentachloride
in the usual way, and then intended to convert it into the amide
and get a melting point for identification. I used equal weights
of the acid and phosphorus pentachloride. I ground them together
at ordinary temperature in a mortar: no result. I heated it on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
a water bath: no result.  I heated it on a gauze over a flame:
no result except decomposition and carbonization. However I
poured water into the mixture and decomposed the excess of
phosphorus pentachloride, and filtered. A gummy brownish
mass remained which was insoluble in all reagents tried,
(methyl and ethyl alcohol, benzine, petroleum ether, (40-60),
water, carbon tetrachloride, dilute hydrochloric acid, acetone,
and acetic acid.) Ethyl ether extracted a very small amount,
just enough to color it yellow, and leave a yellow color on
porcelain on evaporation, but not enough to make a study of
the properties.  On shaking up with concentrated ammonia the
mass became very finely divided, but no solution appeared to
take place; on filtering and evaporating to dryness there was
no residue.</p>

<p>The material mentioned above as being the final
product from the sulphonation of para toluidine, obtained in a
yield of twenty grams or ten per cent yield and then uninvestigated,
has since been identified as the acid I was looking
for, or para toluidine meta sulphonic acid. A small amount
was cooled and diazotized in the usual manner; the diazo
compound seemed to be insoluble in the amount of water used,
for a white crystalline needle-like precipitate appeared.
This was decomposed by boiling with dilute nitric acid (Nevile
and Winther, loc. cit.), and on cooling small tufts of yellow
needles separated.  These were filtered off and dried, then
recrystallized from alcohol.  The best portions of these were
then recrystallized from ether and the melting point determined.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
They melted at 79.5-79.8 (uncorr.). Nevile and Winther gave
79-80, showing that they did not purify their compound.  The
product is dinitro para cresol, or 3-nitro, 4-hydroxy, 5-nitro
toluene.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<h2 id="DIAZOTIZATION_OF_ORTHO_TOLUIDINE_SULPHONIC_ACID">DIAZOTIZATION OF ORTHO TOLUIDINE SULPHONIC ACID.</h2>

<p>Nevile and Winther (loc. cit.), stated that they
obtained a diazo compound from their ortho toluidine sulphonic
acid and described a few properties, but gave no details of
manipulation, so I made several trials to determine the best
acceptable method.</p>

<h3>Experiment 1.</h3>

<p>I suspended some ortho toluidine sulphonic
acid in denatured alcohol, and passed in a rapid current of
nitrous fumes, generated by dropping concentrated nitric acid
into a saturated solution of sodium nitrite, for fifteen minutes.
The suspension became slightly warm, and rather pasty
at the end. I allowed it to stand a half hour, and at the end
of that time it had become very thick and pasty. I then filtered
it off by suction, washed with ether, and dried.</p>

<h3>Experiment 2.</h3>

<p>The procedure used was the same as above using
ethyl alcohol in place of denatured alcohol, but for some
reason no diazotization appeared to take place. The acid was
filtered off and used again.</p>

<h3>Experiment 3.</h3>

<p>A saturated water solution of the acid was made
by boiling some of it up with water, cooling and filtering.
No precipitate appeared on passing in nitrous fumes.</p>

<h3>Experiment 4.</h3>

<p>Some of the acid was dissolved in sodium carbonate
solution, sodium nitrite solution added, and after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
cooling, concentrated hydrochloric acid added drop by drop.
Nitrous fumes were given off, but no precipitate appeared.</p>

<h3>Experiment 5.</h3>

<p>This seems to be the best method and the one
employed hereafter in the preparation of all the material subsequently
used. The solid ortho toluidine sulphonic acid is
suspended in concentrated hydrochloric acid and vigorously
stirred. The solution becomes warm and the crystals change
in appearance, probably due to the formation of the hydrochloride.
The mass is then cooled to 5°, and sodium nitrite
solution added slowly with stirring. Immediate reaction takes
place, and the mass becomes very pasty as in the first experiment.
After obtaining a reaction with starch iodide paper the
mixture was allowed to stand a half hour, then filtered by suction,
washed with ether and dried. In appearance it was identical
with the diazo compound obtained in experiment 1, and can
be kept in the same way.</p>

<p>That it was a diazo compound was shown as follows:
It was spotted on a piece of filter paper with an alkaline solution
of H acid&mdash;a red coloration indicates the formation of a
red azo dyestuff.</p>

<p>Some of the diazo compound was boiled with dilute nitric acid
as described by Nevile and Winther, and a yellowish precipitate
of needles obtained, which on recrystallization from denatured
alcohol gave light yellow needles of dinitro ortho cresol,
(3-hydroxy 3,5-dinitro toluene), melting at 83.5-84° uncorr.
(Nevile and Winther gave 85° for the pure substance.) This
dinitro compound was obtained in nearly quantitative yield
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
indicating that the diazo compound was presumably pure.</p>

<h2 id="PHYSICAL_PROPERTIES_OF_THE_DIAZO_COMPOUND">PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE DIAZO COMPOUND</h2>

<p>It is almost insoluble in water, and is insoluble
in denatured alcohol and ether.</p>

<p>It is a white solid which can be dried and kept
without apparent decomposition; it gradually turns pink when
exposed to the light for several days, so is kept in a brown
bottle if not required for immediate use. It does not explode
when struck with a hammer, but deflagrates violently if a flame
is brought near or if heated on porcelain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<h2 id="DECOMPOSITION_OF_THE_DIAZO_COMPOUND">DECOMPOSITION OF THE DIAZO COMPOUND</h2>

<p>(1) With n-Butyl alcohol in the presence of sodium carbonate.</p>

<p>A portion of the dry diazo compound was placed in a flask
connected with a reflux condenser, and solid sodium carbonate
and n-butyl alcohol added. No reaction took place at ordinary
temperature so heat was applied. Decomposition started at 65°
and evolution of hydrogen proceeded evenly and smoothly until
all the diazo compound had disappeared. The alcohol, at first
colorless, became an orange and finally a brown color. The
solution was then refluxed an hour to ensure complete decomposition
of the diazo compound. The smell of an aldehyde was
evident indicating that the hydrogen reaction was taking place;
the solution was tested with Schiff’s reagent and with ammoniacal
silver nitrate with distinct positive results in both
cases, showing aldehyde was present. The alcoholic solution
was filtered from the sodium carbonate remaining, and the alcohol
distilled off on an oil bath. A yellowish-orange porous
solid was left in such a small amount that no derivatives could
be made and studied. It was free from the diazo compound, shown
by its giving no color with an alkaline solution of H acid.</p>

<h3>(2) With n-Butyl Alcohol alone.</h3>

<p>The previous experiment showed that n-butyl alcohol would
decompose the diazo compound in the presence of sodium carbonate
and replace the amino group by hydrogen, so this time a decomposition
with the alcohol alone was tried. Decomposition took place
evenly and smoothly as before at the same temperature, and the
solution became a clear brownish-orange.  Aldehyde was given
off and tested for as before with positive results. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
alcohol was removed by distillation and a thick brownish
syrupy liquid was left. This was easily soluble in water,
so was dissolved, filtered, and the solution used in the
following experiments. At this point it is similar in
every way to the solution obtained by Griffin (loc. cit.)
from the diazo compound of para toluidine meta sulphonic
acid.</p>

<p>Subsequent preparations of this syrup were made
in the above way with similar results in every case. The
only precaution to be observed is that no part of the flask
containing the reaction mixture be allowed to become too hot
as the diazo compound is then decomposed violently leaving a
grayish ash.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<h2 id="A_STUDY_OF_THE_SOLUTION_OBTAINED_BY_THE_DECOMPOSITION">A STUDY OF THE SOLUTION OBTAINED BY THE DECOMPOSITION
OF THE DIAZO COMPOUND</h2>

<p>The syrup which remained after distilling off
the n-butyl alcohol was a thick brown viscous fluid in all
cases. It has an acid reaction and is completely soluble
in water. On testing it showed the presence of sulphur in
quantity and the absence of nitrogen. Some was dissolved
in water, filtered, and evaporated on the water bath. After
its volume had been considerably reduced it turned a very
dark brown, then blackish, and smelled very tarry. It did
not crystallize at all, finally becoming very black. To a
drop on a watch glass, a drop and then an excess of concentrated
hydrochloric acid was added but with no apparent result.</p>

<p>Another portion of the syrup was dissolved in water,
boiled with purified animal charcoal, and filtered. The filtrate
was colorless. It was then evaporated on the water bath
and solidified completely. Some of this solid was ignited and
a white ash was left; had it been a sulphonic acid there would
have been no residue. A qualitative analysis of the ash was
made and much phosphate and calcium found present; therefore
this solid was presumed to be a mixture of calcium phosphate
from the animal charcoal and perhaps the calcium salt of the
sulphonic acid. This showed that animal charcoal could not
be used for purposes of purification.</p>

<p>“Activated charcoal” has been advocated for decolorizing
solutions as well as for absorbing toxic gases;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the author had become acquainted with this material while
in the Chemical Warfare Service, and had obtained small
samples of “Dorsite” and “Carbonite”. Some of this was
powdered and the brown solution boiled with it until most
of the color was removed. The solution was then filtered
and evaporated on the water bath; a white crystalline solid
was again left. Investigation of the activated charcoal
showed that concentrated acids extracted some substance
which was thrown down in a flocculent white precipitate on
making alkaline with ammonia. Therefore another sample
of the activated charcoal was boiled with concentrated
nitric acid, filtered, and the charcoal washed free from
acid; this sample did not decolorize well.</p>

<p>A sample of a specially prepared charcoal for
decolorizing purposes manufactured by the Barneby-Cheney
Co. was obtained and tried, but was unsuccessful; the color
was not removed.</p>

<p>Infusorial earth, kiesel guhr, and “Sil-o-cel”
were also tried unsuccessfully; Fullers Earth made a very
clear solution but no color was removed.</p>

<p>Some of the brown viscous solution was dissolved
in water, the solution filtered and evaporated to a constant
volume (estimated when no more vapor could be seen to condense)
under diminished pressure (water pump) until it became
more brown. It was then allowed to cool, and dry hydrochloric
acid gas passed in, first to expel all air or other vapor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
present, and then under pressure. The solution became
slightly warm. A few fine crystals formed on the interior
surface of the flask where some of the solution had spattered
during distillation, which however were quite indistinct and
seemed to be in the center of a drop of water or solution.
On allowing the flask to stand over night the whole of the
solution seemed to be filled with crystals. They were too
indistinct to enable their crystalline form to be determined
so an attempt was made to remove some for examination. As
soon as they came into contact with the air they disappeared
and left a very viscous solution, indicating that they are
very hygroscopic. A small amount was removed and placed in
a dish in a vacuum desiccator which was evacuated and left
for a month, with periodical examinations. No solid appeared
at any time.</p>

<p>This is as far as the investigation has been carried
at the present time, April twenty-fifth, but its study is being
continued.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>The results of this investigation may be briefly
summarized as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) Ortho toluidine may be easily converted into its sulphonic
acid in which the sulphonic acid group is in the position
meta to the methyl group.</p>

<p>(2) Para toluidine is converted into a mixture of two isomeric
sulphonic acids of which the one with the sulphonic acid group
in the position meta to the methyl group is obtained in a ten
per cent yield.</p>

<p>(3) Ortho toluidine sulphonic acid may be easily diazotized using
sodium nitrite and concentrated hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>(4) The diazo compound is very stable.</p>

<p>(5) The diazo compound is easily decomposed with n-butyl alcohol,
the hydrogen reaction taking place.</p></blockquote>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
